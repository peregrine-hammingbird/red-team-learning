# Red Team Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey in learning offensive security with a red team mindset.
My goal is to build practical skills in web application penetration testing and Active Directory attacks,
and to clearly explain attack chains, impact, and defensive considerations.

## Focus Areas
- Web Application Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Authentication & Authorization Issues
- Command Injection and Remote Code Execution
- Active Directory Attacks
- Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement
- Basic Detection & Defensive Awareness (Purple Team mindset)

## Learning Approach
- Hands-on labs using platforms such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box
- Manual exploitation before automation
- Clear documentation of:
  - Why the vulnerability exists
  - How the attack works
  - How it could be detected or prevented

## Repository Structure
/writeups

## Tools & Technologies
- Linux (Kali)
- Burp Suite
- Nmap
- Metasploit (conceptual use)
- BloodHound
- Impacket
- Python (basic scripting)

## Current Objective
To become a junior-level penetration tester capable of explaining real-world attack paths
from initial access to privilege escalation and lateral movement.

## Disclaimer
All activities documented in this repository are conducted in legal lab environments
for educational purposes only.

Lastly... I enjoy understanding how small weaknesses can be chained together to compromise an entire system.
