# Red Team Fundamentals

## Overview
This note summarizes core red team concepts learned through
TryHackMe Red Team Fundamentals rooms, focusing on mindset,
engagement structure, and threat intelligence.

## Red Team Engagement Types
- **Assumed Breach**: Simulates a scenario where initial access is already obtained
- **Threat-Informed**: Emulates known adversary TTPs
- **Full Scope**: End-to-end attack simulation from reconnaissance to objectives

Each engagement type serves different testing objectives and maturity levels.

## Red Team Engagement Lifecycle
1. Planning and Scoping
2. Reconnaissance
3. Initial Access
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Lateral Movement
6. Actions on Objectives
7. Reporting and Debrief

Clear objectives and rules of engagement are critical for realistic assessments.

## Threat Intelligence in Red Teaming
- Used to emulate real-world adversaries
- Helps prioritize techniques based on relevance
- Improves realism and detection testing

## Key Takeaways
- Red teaming is objective-driven, not exploit-driven
- Threat intelligence enhances engagement realism
- Collaboration with blue teams increases overall security maturity

## Practical Perspective
Understanding engagement planning and threat intelligence
helps align technical attacks with real business and security objectives.
