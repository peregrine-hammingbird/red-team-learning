# AD DNS Enumeration & Troubleshooting Notes (THM)

## Overview
This repository documents the process of troubleshooting Active Directory DNS resolution
issues encountered during a Red Team / lateral movement lab.

Although full exploitation and lateral movement were not completed, the primary focus was on
systematically identifying why expected connectivity and name resolution failed, which closely
mirrors real-world troubleshooting scenarios.

## Lab Context
- Environment: TryHackMe Active Directory lab
- Attacker Machine: Linux (AttackBox)
- Target Domain: za.tryhackme.com
- Domain Controller IP: 10.200.74.101

---

## Observed Issues
- Standard hostname resolution failed (`NXDOMAIN`)
- Initial assumptions based on lab instructions did not match actual DNS behavior
- AD authentication syntax caused shell-level parsing errors

---

## Investigation & Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. DNS Server Validation
Confirmed that the domain DNS server was reachable:

```bash
nslookup za.tryhackme.com
