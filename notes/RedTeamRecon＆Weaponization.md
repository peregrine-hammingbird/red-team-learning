# TryHackMe – Red Teaming: Initial Access Path

## Overview
This repository documents my progress through the **Initial Access path** of the TryHackMe Red Teaming module.  
The focus is on **reconnaissance** and **weaponization**, which are critical phases in real-world red team operations.

---

## Completed Rooms
- Red Team Recon
- Weaponization

---

## Red Team Recon

In this room, I learned how to gather and analyze target intelligence before an engagement.

### Techniques & Tools
- DNS enumeration
- Advanced search techniques (Google Dorking)
- Recon-ng for automated OSINT collection
- Maltego for relationship and infrastructure mapping

### Key Learnings
- Effective reconnaissance significantly increases the success rate of initial access.
- Understanding a target’s digital footprint is essential before any exploitation attempt.
- Visualizing relationships between entities helps identify potential attack paths.

## Weaponization

This room focused on preparing payloads used to gain initial access during red team engagements.

### Topics Covered
- Common weaponization techniques used by red teams
- Payload customization for specific target environments
- Understanding how payload design affects detection and execution

### Key Learnings
- Weaponization is not just about using tools, but about adapting them to the engagement context.
- Custom payloads are often more effective than default configurations.
- A strong understanding of attacker tradecraft is essential for realistic red team operations.

## Key Takeaways
- Red teaming starts long before exploitation.
- Strong reconnaissance enables more effective weaponization.
- Developing an offensive security mindset is more important than memorizing tools.
