# SOC Level 1 – Blue Team Fundamentals (THM)

## Overview
Completed foundational Blue Team training focused on SOC Level 1 responsibilities.
The modules emphasized alert triage, SOC workflows, and analyst mindset rather than attack execution.

## Completed Modules
### Blue Team Introduction (All Rooms)
- Blue Team roles and responsibilities
- SOC structure and operational flow
- Difference between prevention, detection, and response
- SOC analyst mindset (triage, escalation, documentation)

### SOC Team Internals
#### SOC L1 Alert Triage
- Understanding alerts vs incidents
- Initial alert validation and prioritization
- Identifying false positives vs true positives
- Deciding when and how to escalate alerts
- Importance of evidence-based 판단 rather than assumption

## Key Takeaways
- SOC Level 1 focuses on **recognition and decision-making**, not full investigation
- Not all alerts require deep analysis; knowing *when to stop* is critical
- Clear communication and handoff are core SOC skills
- Blue Team work is about **context, impact, and judgment**

## Reflection
While studying Red Team techniques previously, this module helped connect
attack behaviors with defensive detection logic.
Understanding *why* certain alerts exist made Blue Team workflows clearer.

This reinforced the learning strategy:
> Blue Team as the main focus, Red Team as supporting context when needed.

## Skills Practiced
- Alert triage
- SOC workflow understanding
- Defensive security thinking
- Incident escalation logic
